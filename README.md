## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raghavendra-24/chatbot_project.git
   cd chatbot_project
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**

The `WEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable is required for live weather data. Set it according to your operating system:

### For Windows

1. **Temporary (PowerShell)**: 
   ```powershell
   $env:WEATHER_API_KEY = "66c02b74f5020224d5fcec50c437057b"
   ```

2. **Temporary (Command Prompt)**:
   ```cmd
   set WEATHER_API_KEY=66c02b74f5020224d5fcec50c437057b
   ```

3. **Permanent**:
   - Open **Environment Variables** settings in Windows.
   - Under **User variables**, click **New**.
   - Set `WEATHER_API_KEY` as the **Variable name** and `66c02b74f5020224d5fcec50c437057b` as the **Variable value**.
   - Click **OK** to save.

### For macOS/Linux

Set the environment variable using `export` in the terminal:
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY="66c02b74f5020224d5fcec50c437057b"
```
